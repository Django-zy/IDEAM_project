Here you would find a Jupyter notebook (i.e., Lagragian_Air_quality.ipynb) created by Casallas et al. (2024) doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167350. 
The notebook is self-explanatory since it has many comments, and also an example to reproduce some of the plots that can be found in the main text and the SM of the paper.
The notebook also includes many functions that are not included in the example, but that can be helpfull when calculating diagnostics. 
We add here as drive links where the files needed to run the examples are located. With the idea of making the use of the tracker easier and friendly.

Data from ground-base stations: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LpDeaKP3UlNrdyYf5vvgEFF3_QgwVzIi?usp=sharing
Inside the Pollutant_trend_data directory has a directory called Hourmean which is the one used in the notebook example. The data there is already processed, by calculating each city hour mean.
If you want the raw data, the main directory has directories with the name of each pollutant.

CAMS DATA: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lioe0wWy_S9JKqLDmx5bb5YzlxMfrZuY?usp=sharing
It is important to mention that the data from CAMS is already processed so that the units are ug m-3 (i.e., SO2 and O3). 
The notebook also include the link to make this processing, but meteorological data is needed to do it.
